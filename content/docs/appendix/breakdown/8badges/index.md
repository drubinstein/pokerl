# The 8 Badges

Next, we focused on what it takes to beat the 8 gym leaders. When defeated, gym leaders give the player a "badge.” Badges can unlock the ability to use a field move and give permanent stat modifiers to the agent’s party. Below is a table of the gym leaders of Pokémon, their types and what they unlock.



| **Gym Leader** | **Type** |                       **Reward**                       |
|:--------------:|:--------:|:------------------------------------------------------:|

| Misty<br>![](images/misty.png)          | Water    | <div align="left">- Can use `CUT` outside of battle</align>                        |
| **Lt. Surge**<br>![](images/surge.png)  | Electric | <div align="left">- 12.5% `DEFENSE` boost<br/>- Can use `FLY` outside of battle</align>  |
| **Erika**<br>![](images/erika.png)      | Grass    | <div align="left">- Can use `STRENGTH` outside of battle</align>                   |

| **Sabrina**<br>![](images/sabrina.png)    | Psychic  |                                                        |
| **Blaine**<br>![](images/blaine.png)     | Fire     | <div align="left">-12.5% `SPECIAL`</align> boost                                    |
| Giovanni<br>![](images/giovanni.png)       | Ground   |                                                        |

We emphasized 5 gym leaders. Why? Because these gym leaders can be accomplished in *nearly any order*. The vast majority of storyline events are gated by **Misty, Erika, and Koga** who give access to the field moves `CUT`, `STRENGTH` and `SURF` outside of battle. 

Some gym leaders require solving puzzles or removing environmental guards.

To enter Lt. Surge’s gym you must remove a tree blocking the entrance to his gym with *`CUT`.*

Lt. Surge’s gym contains a button puzzle. To acquire the ability to battle Lt. Surge, you are given an array of trashcans. Two of the trashcans have a button that can be pressed. You must press the two buttons in a specific order. If you mess up, the buttons are randomly assigned to different trashcans.

Subsequently, the agent must acquire the "SECRET KEY” from the Pokémon Mansion next door to his gym *`SURF`*. To battle Blaine, the agent must complete a series of optional True/False quizzes. If the agent incorrectly answers, the agent battles a trainer.

# The Future: Gen II

So what comes next? Well I’ll continue working on this project and at some point plan to make a video of my work and obtain a recording of at least one full playthrough.

But also, I'm thinking of trying the Gen II games, Gold/Silver/Crystal. [Gen II has a decompilation from PRET](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal) and Gen II is easier in one important way; HMs can be used by pressing A in the field instead of extra menu interactions.

However, Gen II is extremely difficult in other ways. There are more HMs and we can’t rely on gift Pokémon for all of them (namely `SURF`, Waterfall and Whirlpool).

I’ve thought of a run that I think will beat the game. With the Totodile starter and a caught Red Gyarados, the agent would have enough Pokémon to satisfy all HMs and  enough Pokémon to beat the game up to Red.

To Be Continued!

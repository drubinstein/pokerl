# Field Interactions and Exploration

Field moves are taught to Pokémon via "HMs." These HMs can only be taught to specific Pokémon.

The 5 field moves of Pokémon are

- **`HM01` - `CUT`**  
- `HM02` - `FLY`  
- **`HM03` - `SURF`**  
- **`HM04` - `STRENGTH`**  
- `HM05` - `FLASH`

Only `CUT`, `SURF`, and `STRENGTH` are required for game progression. Although useful, `FLY` and `FLASH` aren’t required. 

## Using an HM
*Teaching* and using an HM requires a minimum of 17 actions along with a Pokémon in the player's party that is capable of learning the HM. 17+ actions are hard enough to give the player context for. Incentivizing the player to have HM capable party members when it is playing Pokémon for the first time without a guide is an even harder task!

## Acquiring `HM01` - `CUT`

</div>

To acquire `HM01`, the player must: 

- Acquire the SS Anne ticket from Bill north of Cerulean City. 
- Board the SS Anne and battle their rival
- Help the captain of the ship. 

The captain will reward the player with the item `HM01`.

## Acquiring `HM03` - `SURF`

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

To acquire `SURF`, the player must reach the end of the Safari Zone in less than *500* steps. At the end, the Safari Zone Warden will reward the player with `HM03`

## Acquiring `HM04` - `STRENGTH`

<div style="text-align: center;">

{{< figure
  src="assets/teach_use_STRENGTH.gif"
  caption="Teaching and using `HM04` - `STRENGTH`."
  class="ma0 w-75"
>}}

</div>

To acquire `STRENGTH`, the player must:

- Find the `GOLD TEETH` in the Safari Zone.
- Bring the `GOLD TEETH` to the old man NPC in Fuchsia City

The old man will then reward the player with the item `HM04`


## Acquiring and Using the Pokéflute

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

Along with field moves, the player will need to use the item `Pokéflute` for one field interaction. Pokéflute can remove two roadblocks (at least one is required) so the player can gain access to Fuchsia City. 

However, using `Pokéflute` is very similar to using an HM. A level of convenience that I will use when ensuring the player can perform the action.

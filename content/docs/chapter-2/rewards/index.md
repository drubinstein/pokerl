# Rewards

Unlike observations, we were a little more flexible with rewards with respect to leaking information to the agent. Event rewards are too sparse. It can be thousands of steps before a high value event is met. The agent needs some way knowing it is making progress in between these high value sparse rewards. 

### Sparse vs. Dense Rewards

**Sparse rewards** are high value rewards, but rarely occur, e.g. gym battles. If we were to only reward the sparse rewards, the agent would never leave the starting point in Pallet Town.

**Dense rewards** are like breadcrumbs; they occur frequently but with much lower value than a sparse reward. Dense rewards teach the agent how to explore or interact with the world. With dense rewards, the agent can progress and eventually discover the highly valued sparse rewards. 

### Is Exploration All You Need?

Exploration was the foundation for all dense rewards.

We originally believed that an agent had successfully learned Pokémon if the agent could visit every coordinate in the game’s world. We loosened that definition. Now, *any* interaction is considered a form of exploration.

However, we can't only use exploration rewards. If we were to only reward for unique coordinates, the agent never interacts with Brock. Instead, the agent  wanders the world forever collecting new locations until it runs out of locations.

In the end, we rewarded:

- The number of unique coordinates visited during a mini-episode.
- The number of signs interacted the agent interacts with during a mini-episode.
- The number of unique moves taught.
- The number of valid and invalid uses of HMs/Pokéflute in the overworld.   
- The number of tile types an HM/Pokéflute was used on.
- The number of unique map ID transitions (warps) visited during a mini-episode.   
- The number of unique seen and caught Pokémon.

We also experimented with rewarding for all locations an agent has pressed A on and the number of unique menus the agent visited during an episode. However, the A press and unique menus rewards provided little gain and slowed down training tremendously. The agent would frequently press A instead of focusing on navigation.

## Making Game Progress?

Game progress is defined by accomplishing high value sparse rewards. These include:

- All required events completed. A required event is an event required to beat the game. Pokémon has around 80 required events.
- All required items obtained. HMs an example of required items.

Without these rewards, the agent would ultimately wander until the mini-episode reset and make no progress.

## Map ID Rewards

In general, we found that in order to "solve" a map ID and accomplish and event, we needed around 10-20 agents exploring the map ID. 10-20 agents map to around 10% map ID coverage. 

We regretfully "boosted" coordinates reward if the agent explored a currently important map ID. On one hand, we are potentially putting the game on rails. On the other hand, we experienced that the agent would not focus on important areas, e.g., Rocket Hideout, unless we boosted rewards for specific map IDs.

Specific map IDs start the game with a _boosted_ exploration reward *until* the map ID’s objective is complete. For example, a gym has a boosted reward until it is beaten. Only two map IDs break this rule. 

- Route 23 (where the Rival 6 battle occurs) does not get boosted until all gyms are beaten. 
- Lavender Tower does not get boosted until Giovanni is defeated in Rocket Hideout and the Silph Scope is acquired. Otherwise, agents do not leave Lavender due to the level up reward obtained from the wild battles inside Lavender Tower. 

We believe we would not need these rewards if the agent could understand text. Often in Pokémon, an NPC will give hints to the player as to where to go next. Our agent could not parse text and therefore would obviously no where to go.

## Safari Zone Rewards

The Safari Zone minigame provided a big challenge. The Safari Zone is a minigame where two required items must be obtained within 500 steps. The Safari Zone can be attempted as long as you can pay for it. Safari Zone’s route is pretty linear until a fork in the road 75% the way in. We needed to incentivize the agent to get to that fork as fast as possible *and* take the correct fork.

We added a specific Safari Zone reward for this case. The agent obtains a reward proportional to the number of steps left for any map id it reaches within the Safari Zone. Ideally, the agent’s visited mask would prompt the agent to explore both forks within the same episode. In reality, the agent does eventually complete the Safari Zone but it can take thousands of steps during training.

## Level Reward

Peter Whidden suggested a level reward in his video. The level reward 
We took the level reward from Peter Whidden's video without many changes. Any attempt to remove the reward led to a failed experiment.

The level reward:

\begin{equation}
  Reward = 
  \begin{cases}
    \sum_{i=1}^{6} \text{level}_i & if \sum_{i=1}^6 \text{level}_i < 15 \\
    30 + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{6} \text{level}_i - 15}{4} & if \sum_{i=1}^6 \text{level}_i >= 15
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

attempts to find a balance between promoting early game levelling and ensuring the agent is focused on exploration over levelling as the game continues.
